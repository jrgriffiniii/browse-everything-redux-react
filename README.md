## Getting Started

### Installing the Packages

`yarn install` or `npm install`

### Running the Server
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Development

### Validating the Style of the Code

`yarn lint` or `npm lint`

### Running the Test Suites
`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Learn More About React
